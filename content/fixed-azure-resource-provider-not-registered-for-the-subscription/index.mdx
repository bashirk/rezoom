## The Problem
If you have been following any tutorial around creating bots on Azure, and you hit the weird roadblock that tells you;

```
Resource provider Microsoft.BotService not registered for the subscription
```

!['Resource Provider error'](https://github.com/bashirk/azure_webapp_node/raw/assets/Screenshot%202020-08-19%20at%2011.57.24%20AM.png)

Fret not, 'cause you have just stumbled on the fix!


## The Solution
Now, let us walk through the fix together. 

First off, head over to *Subscriptions* (you can search for this from the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com)), then you should select the specific *Subscription* that shows you that error.

Now that you're inside that subscription, search for **Resource Providers**. There would definitely be a lot of providers here, so just do a **filter by name** for ***Bot***, now should see the sneaky cause of the bug;

!['Microsoft.Bot'](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r2zalil5ras1kvg6hhh3.png)

In my case, the Microsoft.BotService Request Provider already indicates *Registered* - and yes, I still see the bug. If it shows *Unregistered*, you do have to register the provider by clicking the *Register* button above the Request Provider. And if it already has a **Registered** green tick (like mine), what we both want to do here is unregister the provider, then register it again. That should work. Simple, innit?


## The Conclusion
And there you have your fix to the *Resource provider not registered bug*. This fix is the way to hard-refresh Request Providers in Azure, works for all Request Providers - not just the Microsoft Bot Service.
