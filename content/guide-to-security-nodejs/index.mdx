## Introduction

![A picture containing multiple keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bashirk/bashirk/static/svg/sec_key.jpg)

In this post, you're going to learn about security in Node.js and best
practices to secure your Node.js apps. Security, in this case, means
safeguarding data. To build great software and systems, you have to
think about security from the first stage of your development roadmap.
This means that security should be at the core of your software
development process. 

This guide will take you through key security concepts to consider when
building software using Node.js. Let's start by seeing how Node.js
already supports security practices. 

### Security and Node.js: A Primer

Most importantly, the strength of the Node.js core lies in the community
around it. The Node.js community prioritizes security as a key factor in
the development of Node.js. This has led to the creation of the Node.js
[Security Working
Group (SWG)](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg), whose
mission is to improve the security of applications built using Node.js.
It does so by bringing vulnerability data from the community to the Node
Security Platform, while also maintaining the vulnerability data on
disclosed security vulnerabilities. The SWG also ensures vulnerabilities
in Node packages are properly documented and, consequently, makes known
security issues openly reported. 

However, you should note that SWG is *not* responsible for managing or
responding to security reports against Node.js itself. The [Node.js
TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) owns that
responsibility. 

## Relevant Libraries or Frameworks in Node.js

Node.js has several modules that improve the efficiency of software
applications. Accordingly, properly integrating these modules will
improve the security of your Node.js applications. In addition, these
modules are free to add, and they improve the overall efficiency of
Node.js apps while tightening up loose ends. I'm going to go over a few
of these libraries and frameworks. 

### 1. Express.js

The first on the list is
[Express](https://expressjs.com/), which is a Node.js
framework that you can use when you need to easily handle verb actions
like GET, POST, and DELETE requests in Node.js. It handles each of these
requests with different paths known as routes. Express.js uses the
Node.js middleware idea to deliver middleware modules that solve
specific and key problems in Node.js like security. 

Next on the list is Helmet.   

### 2. Helmet.js

[Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) is an Express
middleware, and it helps in setting various HTTP response headers for
securing GET and POST requests in Node.js apps. It's used as an HTTP
Headers Security module. It delivers middleware functions that set HTTP
headers. 

These HTTP headers include the following: 

-   **helmet.contentSecurityPolicy()** sets the Content-Security-Policy header, which helps mitigate cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).

-   **helmet.xssFilter()** disables browsers' buggy cross-site scripting filter by setting the X-XSS-Protection header to 0.

You can go through [this list](https://helmetjs.github.io/) to see all the HTTP headers you can set up in your Node.js application using Helmet. 

Next, we'll go through the Node.js module for securing passwords,
Bcrypt. 

### 3. Bcrypt

[Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is a
password security module offered by Node.js. The Bcrypt library protects
users from attacks like brute forcing. This is made possible through a
hashing method called salting. To clarify, salting is a technique that
involves the act of adding random strings to passwords before the actual
hashing takes place. 

In order to do that, "the Bcrypt library uses a **.genSalt()** method
to generate a salt and hash," according to the Bcrypt documentation. 

With separate functions for both salt and hash, you can generate a
password hash, and then a salt, like below. 
```js
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, function(err, salt) {
  bcrypt.hash(PlainPassword, salt, function(err, hash) {
    // Store password hash in database
  });
});
```
And with separate function calls, you can auto-generate both a salt and
a hash, like below. 
```js
bcrypt.hash(PlainPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
  // Store password hash in database
});
```
Passwords can be checked for correctness by using the block of code
below. The function returns **true** when the hashed password matches
the plain password. 
```js
// Load hash from your password DB.
bcrypt.compare(PlainPassword, hash, function(err, result) {
  // result == true
});
```

### 4. Validator.js

Next on the list is Validator, which is an input validation module. It
enforces the need for user inputs to be what they're required to be. In
the same vein, it ensures input correctness. [This
list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) includes all
the validators you can configure with the Validator package. 

### 5. ESLint Plugin

Another way to improve your Node.js app's security is to integrate
ESLint, which is a linting security plugin that helps to identify
vulnerable Node.js code during development. Vulnerable code
implementations include unsafe regular expressions, an 'await' keyword
inside *for* loops, and so on. 

You can get more details on how to use this plugin to write less
vulnerable code
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security). 

## Security Best Practices

Regardless of what applications you're building with Node.js, you
should carry out key security procedures at the first stage of
development. So, to keep your Node.js application secure and free of
vulnerabilities, it's important to implement essential security best
practices while building out your Node.js app. We'll go through a
couple of those in this section. 

### Always Audit Node Modules

Firstly, it's imperative to always audit each node module you use in
your project for vulnerability checks. Auditing helps to confirm which
package is available for an upgrade. When you audit packages, you're
also confirming the security of the package. 

Consequently, in order to audit packages/modules and check for
vulnerable dependencies, you can use tools like Snyk, Node Security
Project (NSP), or run npm-audit to track down and patch
vulnerabilities.

### Always Use Rate Limiting

Secondly, attacks like brute forcing are a common security threat to
Node.js apps, and login routes are the most targeted for this form of
attack. Rate limiting helps to limit the impact of brute force attacks.
The Node.js
[ratelimiter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ratelimiter)
package helps in the integration of rate limiting into your Node.js
apps. With the ratelimiter module, you can limit middleware
implementation against the ID of a user. 
```js
var id = req.user._id;
var limit = new Limiter({ id: id, db: db });
limit.get(function(err, limit){
  if (err) return next(err);
  res.set('X-RateLimit-Limit', limit.total);
  res.set('X-RateLimit-Remaining', limit.remaining - 1);
  res.set('X-RateLimit-Reset', limit.reset);

  // looks good
  debug('remaining %s/%s %s', limit.remaining - 1, limit.total, id);
  if (limit.remaining) return next();

  // does not look good
  var delta = (limit.reset * 1000) - Date.now() | 0;
  var after = limit.reset - (Date.now() / 1000) | 0;
  res.set('Retry-After', after);
  res.send(429, 'Rate limit exceeded, retry in ' + ms(delta, { long: true }));
});
```

The Express Brute
[package](https://libraries.io/npm/express-brute) also
does rate limiting to mitigate brute forcing and denial of service (DoS)
attacks. 

### Use TLS/SSL for Data Transmission

Thirdly, data confidentiality is important when transmitting data from
one layer to the other, to prevent sniffing from potential attackers.
One common way to secure the transport of data through encryption is to
use transport layer security (TLS) and secure sockets layer (SSL). To
clarify, SSL encrypts the client-server connection end to end, and TLS
secures password data and sensitive information like credit card
details. 

### Escape Outputs

Furthermore, in order to avoid injection attacks like cross-site
scripting (XSS), output escaping plays a key role. XSS will be explained
later in this post. To escape outputs in your code, you can make use of
the [Node ES API
library](https://github.com/ESAPI/node-esapi) or the
[Escape HTML
library](https://github.com/component/escape-html) to
escape all JavaScript and HTML code that users get access to. 

### Log and Monitor Your Apps

Finally, loads on servers can cause DoS, which may lead to app downtime.
It's therefore important to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic into
the servers, and you can always be alerted when servers are under
extreme load. And if your servers are crashing not because of extreme
loads, but due to security attacks, it's imperative to use logs
properly to understand how and when the security attack happened. The
[Bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan) Node.js
module helps in the efficient logging of your Node.js services. The
[TooBusy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toobusy-js)
Node.js module is an essential tool for monitoring Node.js apps. 

The [OWASP Node.js Security Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#nodejs-security-cheat-sheet)
includes a comprehensive list of security best practices. Understanding
security attacks and key ways to mitigate these attacks is a key
security embrace---and this is what the next section entails. 

## Most Common Node.js Security Attacks

There are several Node.js security attacks, but we'll review the common
ones in detail in this section. 

### SQL Injection

[SQL
injection](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/what-is-sql-injection/)
involves the insertion of an SQL query through input data from the user
to the application. These attacks make use of areas in applications that
ask for user inputs. The attacker carrying out the SQL injection attack
will be able to gain access to the database of the application after a
successful attack. You can read more on SQL injection on StackHawk. 

To prevent an injection attack, input validation is key, and the
Validator package mentioned above helps with proper input validation.
The Validator module has allowlist and blocklist validation methods that
are about explicitly declaring what you want to be authorized in your
input validation process and blocking out everything else. 

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

[XSS](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/what-is-cross-site-scripting-xss/)
involves the injection of client-side scripts into websites. With XSS,
attackers are able to manipulate web applications with the aim of
sending malicious code to the users of the web app. XSS attacks have the
objective of either stealing users' data or taking control of the web
application. 

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bashirk/bashirk/static/svg/xss.png)

To [prevent an XSS
attack](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/nodejs-xss-guide-examples-and-prevention/),
you'll need to use secure HTTP headers according to the requirements of
your project. Helmet, mentioned above, delivers middleware functions
that set secure HTTP headers. 

### Command Injection

Command injection involves the injection of input that alters valid and
legal commands in vulnerable applications in order to execute illegal
commands against the operating system. This attack is mostly against the
system shell. The input injection can come from any source that the user
can modify, such as forms. This attack targets the system shell. 

Again, [to prevent an injection
attack](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/nodejs-command-injection-examples-and-prevention/),
input validation is key. 

### Cross-Site Resource Forgery (CSRF)

[CSRF](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/node-js-csrf-protection-guide-examples-and-how-to-enable-it/)
is a form of session hijacking where a user is forced to run malicious
actions on an application that they're currently authenticated to. In a
CSRF attack, attackers hijack the sessions of real users, thereby
bypassing security rules for non-users. 

To prevent CSRF attacks, you need to implement tokens that will be
generated on the server side. The
[csurf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csurf) Node.js
package helps in the generation of valid CSRF tokens.
[OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#rule---use-cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generators-csprng)
has also provided best practices for generating tokens. 

### Path Traversal

[Path
traversal](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/node-js-path-traversal-guide-examples-and-prevention/)
involves the act of accessing directories in a file server illegally due
to weak security validation. In this kind of attack, an attacker is able
to access server files by the injection of malicious user inputs into
the web application. This attack feeds upon vulnerable implementations
of access control settings.

To prevent an attack of this form, allowlisting plays a key role. Input
validation plays a vital role, too. 

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned about security essentials in Node.js, the
packages and libraries available to mitigate vulnerability attacks, and
best practices to tighten up security in your Node.js app. Certainly,
security should be a priority during development and enmeshed in every
facet of your next Node.js app.
